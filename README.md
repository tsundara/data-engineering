# Data Engineering

How would you bootstrap a Data Team? Here below a "laundry list" of tasks, resources, job profiles, and blueprints on how to build a dream data team. Mission: manage all the data, learn from it, and deliver concrete and tangible business results to the rest of the organization.

## Team

Profiles share both a Dev and Production Load.
 - 1x [Infra](profiles/infra.md) (Metal, Physical, Metal as a service, IaaS)
 - 1x [DevOps](profiles/devops.md) (Stack automation,, Containers and Platform as a service)
 - 2x [Data Engineer](profiles/data.md) (Data Pipelines, Data Automation, Data as a Service, Data Ingestion)
 - 2x [Analytics](profiles/analytics.md) (1x Batch Analytics, 1x Real-Time Analytics and Predictive APIs)
 - 1x [AI and ML](profiles/ai.md) (Machine Learning and AI algorithms)
 - 1x [Front-End Dev](profiles/frontend.md) (Web and Js developer, web and mobile apps)

Extended team: for small scale projects, above profiles can cover the  extended team's tasks:

 - 1x Network Architect
 - 1x Security Engineer
 - 1x Community Writer
 - 1x Data Viz Developer

## Principles

 - Python is the default language for the data stack.
 - Engineers over Scientists
 - Convention over Configuration over Coding.
 - More thinking less typing
 - Keep it simple
 - Re-use over Integrate over Build.
 - Service Oriented (CLI, Web HTTP APIs , Python Libraries)
 - Be kind, be curious

### Tools Specific Principles
#### Spark
Spark is a library with many cohexisting layers, mostly because of back compatibility some of this APIs are still around both in the tool as well on the web with many Q&A still going round. When learning Spark please follow the following principles:

 - pyspark only (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/)
 - Learn ONLY the modules: pyspark.sql and pyspark.ml
 - Skip anything related to Scala, Java, R (according to the above general principle)
 - Skip categorically anything about RDDs, Map-Reduce, and MLlib

#### Git
Git is meant for people to experiment, develop and merge working code on a common master branch.   
Please follow the given principles.
 - No working branches on the shared remote (gitlab/github) repo
 - Pull requests over commits
 - Diff and Test the code *before* commiting

Best way of working:
 - fork the remote common repository from gitlab/github
 - add multiple remotes to keep track on changes and rebase/marge if necessary
 - commit to your remote and pull request to the main repo.

 ## Data Science
 Data science must be conducted with a predictable and well defined process.  
 All experiments should be conducted according to the following steps:

  1. problem statement
  2. hypotheses and assumptions
  3. expected results
  4. sketched solution
  5. validate assumptions
  6. collect results
  7. analyze results
  8. story telling
  9. lessons learned

 Main focus on data science is to understand the why's behind the numbers. So it's very important to:
  - be critical on both results and assumptions
  - no opinions but evidence based on maths, in particular statistics
